# Scaling of SW diffractons

* Make a directory called ./_output_isolated_waves.
* Cut the first 4 diffractons (using the simulation with sig2=10) from frame 340 (see misc/cutting/).
* Copy the first four isolated waves (the wave1, ..., wave4 files) into ./_output_isolated_waves.
* Run `scaling.py`.
