# Results related to the homogenized equations

* Run `run_sw_eqns.py` to produce the FV simulation of the SW equations.
* Run `run_plot.py` to generate .csv files with the FV solution.
* Copy the .csv files to the folder called ./matlab.
* Inside the folder ./matlab:
  * Run `solver.m` to produce the spectral simulation of the homogenized system.
  * Run `plot_solutions.m` to generate some .csv files.
  * Run `plot_solutions.py` to generate the figure in the paper.
