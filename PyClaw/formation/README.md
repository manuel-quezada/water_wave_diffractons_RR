# FV simulations of SW diffractons

* Edit `run_sw_eqns.py` to select sig2=2 or sig2=10.
* Run `run_sw_eqns.py` to produce the FV simulation.
  * Note: the refinement level is given by refn=4 which corresponds to Nx=Ny=128 cells in each direction.
* Edit `run_plot.py` to select name='diffracton_var2' or name='diffracton_var10'.
* Run `run_plot.py` to produce plots of the FV simulation and the plots in the paper.
