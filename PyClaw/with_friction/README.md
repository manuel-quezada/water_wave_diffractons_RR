# SW diffractons with friction

* Edit `run_sw_eqns.py` to select the friction coefficient.
* Run `run_sw_eqns.py` to generate the data for the corresponding simulation.
* Place the data inside ./_output/cf_XX where XX={0.0, 0.025, 0.033, 0.05}.
* Once the data for all the simulations is created, run `run_plot.py` to generate the figures in the paper.
